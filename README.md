Count D's Dotfiles
==================

This repository holds most of my custom linux config files. It's not really that interesting.

For the time being you have to create symlinks in your ~ for those files by hand.

In addition, the following needs to be done:
* Create a folder ~/.vim-tmp/ for vim swap files
* Make sure your terminal supports 256 colors (on Debian, install rxvt-unicode-256color)
